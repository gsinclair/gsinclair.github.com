gsinclair.github.com -- gsinclair's "GitHub Pages" page

Intended to contain documentation for gsinclair's github projects.

See http://gsinclair.github.com

Workflow:
 * edit documents (e.g. col.markdown) in this project
 * `jekyll --server` to preview them at http://localhost:4000
 * copy the document to its project (e.g. col) and git commit
 * git commit in gsinclair.github.com as well

`git push` to gsinclair.github.com causes the new document to go live.
